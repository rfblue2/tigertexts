Drawing on ethnographic and clinical studies as well as documentary films, we examine how lines are drawn between normal and pathological, and explore the intertwining of psyche, body, and morality in human experience and behavior."},

We consider formal and informal institutions (e.g., courts, legislatures, police, workplaces, families) and a range of formal and informal norms (from court rulings to common sense).  Authority and obligation emerge as complex social relations that shape and are shaped within and across cultural contexts."},

What are the possibilities and pitfalls of alternative and non-traditional archives? How do we as embodied actors shape the archives with which we engage--as historians, critical scholars, participants, and curators?"},

Many of these end up as personal or environmental contaminants. There is growing evidence that exposure to these pollutants can interfere with health and reproduction in both humans and wildlife.

We will read and watch television shows, pitch ideas, work in writers' rooms, and by the end of the semester have a complete draft of a television pilot in hand (50-60 pages). There will be weekly reading, viewing, and writing assignments - everything from conceptualizing ideas to writing outlines and character profiles.  Given that television is a collaborative medium, students should feel comfortable working in small groups."},

For centuries, artists and image-makers have incorporated the concepts and claims of scientific inquiry into their practices. Scientists, in turn, have relied on images as both sources of and evidence for scientific knowledge. By examining the interaction of art and science in Europe and America from the early modern period to the present day, this course will investigate the diverse and complex ways in which art and science have intersected as well as the manner in which image-making has been understood as a form of scientific practice."},

Although it could be argued that each epoch in the modern era has been regarded by its contemporary as a time of crisis, the present moment seems to offer certain particular traits in terms of the quality, intensity and spread of its crisis - ecological, social, political, moral, cognitive. How can we analyze the insistent discourse on crisis, with its apocalyptic resonance, as well as the actual situation of crisis, with its multiple facets? How are critique and crisis related?
